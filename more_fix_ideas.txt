idea for the build/adujust prod script.

the export should happen in real time as each piece is processed in the prod file
instead of just inputting all the data and then going back to loop through everything again
to export each piece (what if we don't want to export all the pieces again..?)

for size in roster
	for each piece in size
		create artboard around piece
		check for text frames
		if frames
			make live text group
			make roster group
			for each player in size
				duplicate live text group to roster group
				rename
				update contents
				duplicate current roster group for expansion
				hide current roster group
				expand duplicate roster group
					(need to figure out how to get expansion prefs..)
				export customized garment piece
		else
			export plain garment piece
