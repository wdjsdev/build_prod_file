adjustment dialog ideas:

when you click on a listbox, highlight the roster listbox so you can quickly jump to using the arrow keys
assign hotkeys to the roster listbox
	hit s to toggle through to the next size in the list
	hit p to toggle through to the next piece in the list
update the "assign garments to layers" dialog. it SUCKS
maybe a button to "convert case" of one or all player names
export individual roster piece (back with name/number)
